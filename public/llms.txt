# Peanut Butter AND JAM (PBJ)

## About
Peanut Butter AND JAM is a JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) protocol implementation. It provides Safrole consensus, a Gray Paper–compliant PVM (Para Virtual Machine), JAMNP-S networking, codec and types, erasure coding and assurance, and JIP-2 Node RPC tooling. Built by Esscrypt Ltd.

## Tech summary
- **Safrole**: Consensus (Gray Paper Section 3, safrole.tex). Ticket generation, sealing, epoch markers, fallback sealing.
- **PVM**: Para Virtual Machine (pvm.tex). Host functions, instructions, RAM, refinement invocations.
- **JAMNP-S**: JAM Simple Networking Protocol over QUIC and TLS 1.3. Block announcement, state/work requests, ticket distribution, work packages, audits.
- **Codec & types**: Serialization and types (serialization.tex, definitions.tex). Blob/program decoding, extrinsic hashing.
- **Erasure & assurance**: Erasure coding (erasure_coding.tex), reporting assurance (reporting_assurance.tex).
- **RPC**: JIP-2 Node RPC server (Elysia), WebSocket subscriptions, node services (validators, guarantors, builders, networking).

Implementation follows the Gray Paper as the authoritative spec; test vectors from jamtestvectors validate compliance.
